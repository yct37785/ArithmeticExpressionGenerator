# Arithmetic Expression Generator
Generate a random arithmetic expression with the output value using an AST. Works with addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.

The algorithm will attempt to flatten the expression, i.e. remove brackets, wherever possible.

Developed for an upcoming game project.
